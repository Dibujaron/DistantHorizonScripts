Distant Horizon is a game about realistic space travel. You play as a merchant spaceship captain flying between space stations in a large solar system, using flip-and-burn type trajectories to navigate between orbiting planets. All players exist in the same universe, and there are AI ships that also participate. At the moment the gameplay is simple peddler-trading of goods, but in the future we plan to add routefinding gameplay (where charting new, faster paths between stations will provide royalties), as well as passenger transportation, contract operations, and possibly some form of combat. 

DH is implemented in Kotlin for the server, Godot Engine compiling to WASM for the client, and Python/Flask for the load balancer.
